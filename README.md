eink.el
===========

Eink is a minimalistic color theme for Emacs.

History
---------

At some point i was really sick about my code being full of colorized bullshit.
So i created this color theme. Just black letters on the white background, that was all i needed. But after a week of usage, i turned syntax highlightning on for string literals and comments, making them grey.

Theme works just fine for me (i mainly use python-, haskell-, scala- and org- modes). If you have any issues with coloring in other modes -- feel free to ask me to fix it.

TODO

TODO:
* [X] Create theme
* [ ] Pull request to melpa
* [X] Write installation guide
* [X] Add a few screenshots


Usage
--------------

Copy `eink-theme.el` file right into `~/.emacs.d/themes` directory (create this one if you haven't already).
Then you can load this theme by invoking `M-x load-theme` command.
