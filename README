[ eink.vim ]

This is a vim color theme designed to emulate reading on an eink device.
It supports both a light background (which is the normal eink-style
reading mode) and a dark background for late night hacking.

In general, there is no syntax highlighting. Notably, however, comments
are slightly dimmed just enough to be distinguishable and string literals
are underlined.

[ installation ]
To install, copy colors/eink.vim to ~/.vim/colors/ (or wherever you're
keeping color themes).

[ license ]
eink.vim is released under the ISC license.

[ family tree ]
eink.vim was originally based on kyle.vim, my custom colors.
kyle.vim in turn was largely taken from jcs' jcs.vim[1]. color
codes were inspired by a number of themes, namely wombat256.vim.
